# AWS CloudFormation Templates
This repo is a helper to create empty shells on AWS Cloud for different scenarios so we can quickly get started with our development without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Each template will have its own GitHub Workflow associated so you can run them independently.

## Base Configuration
All workflows will require you to have three GitHub Secrets setup:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - AWS Access ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - AWS Access Screte Key
- AWS_REGION - AWS Region where the resources will be created

## Templates
